            <h2 class="pt-20">Gender parity in sports will need focused planning & training</h2>
            <p>Sports is one area where gender parity has not been properly nurtured in India. There had always been rare talents who would break through the surface catching everyone’s eye—but never did we see planning for sports dedicated to girl child or gender roadmap on how to build women talent in sports. According to the latest research by BBC, the statistics shows that approximately 75% of the Indian population believe sports is significant in their day-to-day lives, however, only 36% of the population engage in any sort of sport or physical activity. Of these 42% of men and only 29% of women engage in sports.</p>
            <p>The millennium however is seeing a steady shift, where more girls are encouraged to join sports in every field. The number of girls coming forward may not be large, but the names like Karnam Malleswari, Mary Kom, Saina Nehwal, PV Sindhu, Sakshi Malik, Mirabai Chanu are slowly becoming recognizable, enforcing the slow revolution. Performance is bigger than any policy while motivating these girls aspiring to be sports personalities—however, the government and academies need to take cognizance of the situation and push Sports education as a curriculum for girl child and create an ecosystem that can encourage more girls to get professionally trained.</p>

            <h3>Spotlight on Cricket as a starting point </h3>
            <p>The starting point to push more girl talent into sports is obvious, given that cricket has always been the glamorous golden goose of Indian sports scene. Success in this field and various career options going ahead is something that the parents and guardians understand. While study shows that attitudes towards women and women’s sports in India are complex, contradictory and counterintuitive, the current performance of Indian women team had been in focus. Names and performance of Smriti Mandhana, Mithali Raj, Harmanpreet Kaur, Shafali Verma, Shweta Sehrawat , Richa Ghosh are demanding enough attention as the Men’s Cricket team.</p>
            <p>Data shows that 15% of women play cricket compared to 25% of the men in India, indicating the huge gender inequality in cricket. Surprisingly, the story is not same in kabaddi, where 15% of men and 11% of women participate in the sport. The point was well taken by BCCI who announced the pay-parity in cricket across gender, thus empowering the “Women in Blue”, and also smoothening the process for new aspirants. Going forward, the match fee for both men and women Cricketers will be same as India moves into a new era of gender equality in Cricket.</p>

            <h3>Maturing Ecosystem for Aspirant Girl Cricketers</h3>
            <p>The scenario for Women’s cricket just got more lucrative with a women’s IPL expected to be announced in 2023. This would not only create the same opportunities in employment and skills-building for female players as it has for males but will also tap in the resources and talents at Under 15 and Under 19 playing teams. The need of the hour will be to pen down a proper plan to grow women’s cricket, a commitment to investing time and money in the team – and accountability for reaching those goals. Policy wise, there needs to be a separate wing for women’s cricket that can take independent decisions.</p>
            <p>A lot of burden and commitment also comes in at the academy and club level who are generally the scouting bodies for talent. Awareness creation for parents, supporting the girl talents with the required ecosystem and helping them overcome the societal pressure. Investments only offer excellent results if we do it for 5-10 years in a continuous basis before it gets self-momentum. In a similar manner, developing women cricket and beyond will need women trainers, medical officers, coaches and helpers to help them cross the barrier of dogmatic social pressure and following their dream.</p>

            <h3>Sports as a Career for Women</h3>
            <p>Last but not the least, sports training and knowledge about a particular game help create many career options, beyond the playing age. A women centric sport environment will need women coaches, women mentors, helper, medical attendants and what not directly related to the game. Indirectly coverage of sports, commentary and getting engaged at club level will continue to be important areas of activity for trained personals. It will be interesting to see how, India’s ecosystem matures– seeing women break the glass ceiling of professionalism and lead the way through Cricket and in a larger way through sports. </p>
